The .gitignore file is used in Git to specify which files and directories should be ignored by version control. 
When you create a .gitignore file in your repository, you can list patterns that match files you don't want to track. 
For example:

    *.log ignores all log files.
    temp/ ignores the entire temp directory.
    *.tmp ignores all files with a .tmp extension.

When you run Git commands, it will automatically exclude these specified files from being tracked or staged for commit. 
This is useful for preventing sensitive information, temporary files, or build artifacts from being included in your repository.
